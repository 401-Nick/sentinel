****Revisor's Note:  Due to the delayed effective date of SB 491 and HB 1371, Section B of both bills were merged and codified by inserting the statutory section numbers for the sections contained in SB 491 and HB 1371.  Section 305.580, which was not contained in either SB 491 or HB 1371, was inadvertently codified in this section instead of Section 302.580, which was contained in SB 491, due to an apparent typographical error.

  (2)  It is specifically denominated by statute as a lesser degree of the offense charged; or
  (3)  It consists of an attempt to commit the offense charged or to commit an offense otherwise included therein.
  2.  The court shall not be obligated to charge the jury with respect to an included offense unless there is a rational basis for a verdict acquitting the person of the offense charged and convicting him or her of the included offense.  An offense is charged for purposes of this section if:
  (1)  It is in an indictment or information; or
  (2)  It is an offense submitted to the jury because there is a rational basis for a verdict acquitting the person of the offense charged and convicting the person of the included offense.
  3.  The court shall be obligated to instruct the jury with respect to a particular included offense only if the instruction is requested and there is a rational basis in the evidence for acquitting the person of the immediately higher included offense and convicting the person of that particular included offense.

(1981) Statute providing that defendant may be convicted of offense included in offense charged is legislative determination that offense can be a lesser offense of another offense so that charge of greater will support conviction of lesser although lesser is not necessarily included in greater; declining to follow State v. Handley, 585 S.W.2d 458, to extent of conflict. State v. Wilkerson (Mo.), 616 S.W.2d 829.
(1981) Statute must be construed as requiring an instruction on a lesser-included offense only where there is evidence of probative value which could form basis of an acquittal of greater offense and a conviction of lesser-included offense.  State v. Hill (A.), 614 S.W.2d 744.

  11.  A judge may order payment to a restitution fund only if such fund had been created by ordinance or resolution of a county of the state of Missouri prior to sentencing.  A judge shall not have any direct supervisory authority or administrative control over any fund to which the judge is ordering a person to make payment.
  12.  A person who fails to make a payment to a county law enforcement restitution fund may not have his or her probation revoked solely for failing to make such payment unless the judge, after evidentiary hearing, makes a finding supported by a preponderance of the evidence that the person either willfully refused to make the payment or that the person willfully, intentionally, and purposefully failed to make sufficient bona fide efforts to acquire the resources to pay.
  13.  Nothing in this section shall be construed to allow the sentencing advisory commission to issue recommended sentences in specific cases pending in the courts of this state.

  3.  A court may cause any sentence it imposes to run concurrently with a sentence an individual is serving or is to serve in another state or in a federal correctional center.  If the Missouri sentence is served in another state or in a federal correctional center, subsection 4 of section 558.011 and section 217.690 shall apply as if the individual were serving his or her sentence within the department of corrections of the state of Missouri, except that a personal hearing before the parole board shall not be required for parole consideration.

(1991) Although statute requires consecutive sentences any time a sex crime is committed at the same time as any other felony, even if the additional felony is also a sex crime, the sentencing court has discretion to run sentences concurrently, when a defendant's convictions consist only of sex offenses.

  (b)  The probation violation is not the result of the defendant being an absconder or being found guilty of, pleading guilty to, or being arrested on suspicion of any felony, misdemeanor, or infraction.  For purposes of this subsection, "absconder" shall mean an offender under supervision who has left such offender's place of residency without the permission of the offender's supervising officer for the purpose of avoiding supervision;
  (c)  The defendant has not violated any conditions of probation involving the possession or use of weapons, or a stay-away condition prohibiting the defendant from contacting a certain individual; and

  (2)  Upon receiving the order, the department of corrections shall conduct an assessment of the offender and place such offender in either the one hundred twenty-day structured cognitive behavioral intervention program or the one hundred twenty-day institutional treatment program.  The placement of the offender in the structured cognitive behavioral intervention program or institutional treatment program shall be at the sole discretion of the department based on the assessment of the offender.  The program shall begin upon receipt of the offender by the department.  The time between the court's order and receipt of the offender by the department shall not apply toward the program.
  (3)  Upon successful completion of a program under this subsection, as determined by the department, the division of probation and parole shall advise the sentencing court of the defendant's probationary release date thirty days prior to release.  Once the defendant has successfully completed a program under this subsection, the court shall release the defendant to continue to serve the term of probation, which shall not be modified, enlarged, or extended based on the same incident of violation.
  (4)  If the department determines the defendant has not successfully completed a one hundred twenty-day program under this section, the division of probation and parole shall advise the prosecuting attorney and the sentencing court of the defendant's unsuccessful program exit and the defendant shall be removed from the program.  The defendant shall be released from the department within fifteen working days after the court is notified of the unsuccessful program exit, unless the court has issued a warrant in response to the unsuccessful program exit to facilitate the return of the defendant to the county of jurisdiction for further court proceedings.  If a defendant is discharged as unsuccessful from a one hundred twenty-day program, the sentencing court may modify, enlarge, or revoke the defendant's probation based on the same incident of the violation.
  (5)  Time served in the program shall be credited as time served on any sentence imposed for the underlying offense.
  5.  If the defendant consents to the revocation of probation or if the defendant is not eligible under subsection 4 of this section for placement in a program and a continuation, modification, enlargement, or extension of the term under this section is not appropriate, the court may revoke probation and order that any sentence previously imposed be executed.  If imposition of sentence was suspended, the court may revoke probation and impose any sentence available under section 557.011.  The court may mitigate any sentence of imprisonment by reducing the prison or jail term by all or part of the time the defendant was on probation.  The court may, upon revocation of probation, place an offender on a second term of probation.  Such probation shall be for a term of probation as provided by section 559.016, notwithstanding any amount of time served by the offender on the first term of probation.
  6.  Probation shall not be revoked without giving the probationer notice and an opportunity to be heard on the issues of whether such probationer violated a condition of probation and, if a condition was violated, whether revocation is warranted under all the circumstances.  Not less than five business days prior to the date set for a hearing on the violation, except for a good cause shown, the judge shall inform the probationer that he or she may have the right to request the appointment of counsel if the probationer is unable to retain counsel.  If the probationer requests counsel, the judge shall determine whether counsel is necessary to protect the probationer's due process rights.  If the judge determines that counsel is not necessary, the judge shall state the grounds for the decision in the record.
  7.  The prosecuting or circuit attorney may file a motion to revoke probation or at any time during the term of probation, the court may issue a notice to the probationer to appear to answer a charge of a violation, and the court may issue a warrant of arrest for the violation.  Such notice shall be personally served upon the probationer.  The warrant shall authorize the return of the probationer to the custody of the court or to any suitable detention facility designated by the court.  Upon the filing of the prosecutor's or circuit attorney's motion or on the court's own motion, the court may immediately enter an order suspending the period of probation and may order a warrant for the defendant's arrest.  The probation shall remain suspended until the court rules on the prosecutor's or circuit attorney's motion, or until the court otherwise orders the probation reinstated.  Notwithstanding any other provision of the law to the contrary, the probation term shall be tolled during the time period when the probation is suspended under this section.  The court may grant the probationer credit on the probation term for any of the tolled period when reinstating the probation term.
  8.  The power of the court to revoke probation shall extend for the duration of the term of probation designated by the court and for any further period which is reasonably necessary for the adjudication of matters arising before its expiration, provided that some affirmative manifestation of an intent to conduct a revocation hearing occurs prior to the expiration of the period and that every reasonable effort is made to notify the probationer and to conduct the hearing prior to the expiration of the period.  If the delay of the hearing is attributable to the probationer's actions or the probationer otherwise consents or acquiesces to the delay, the court shall have been found to have made every reasonable effort to conduct the hearing within the probation term.
  9.  A defendant who was sentenced prior to January 1, 2017 to an offense that was eligible at the time of sentencing under paragraph (a) of subdivision (1) of subsection 4 of this section for the court ordered detention sanction shall continue to remain eligible for the sanction so long as the defendant meets all the other requirements provided under subsection 4 of this section.

(1980) Armed criminal action statute which permitted conviction on charge of robbery first degree and on the same facts permitted conviction for armed criminal action was unconstitutional in that it violated the double jeopardy clause of the fifth amendment to the U.S. Constitution. Sours v. State (Mo.), 603 S.W.2d 592.
(1981) After reexamination in light of Albernaz v. United States, 450 U.S. 333, 101 S.Ct. 1137, 67 L.Ed.2d 275 (1981), the position of the Supreme Court expressed in Sours v. State, 603 S.W.2d 592 is affirmed, that by enacting statutes proscribing armed criminal action and robbery in the first degree with a dangerous and deadly weapon, the legislature intended to twice punish defendant for the same offense in violation of the double jeopardy clause of the Fifth Amendment. State v. Haggard (Mo.), 619 S.W.2d 44.
(1981) If evidence in case supports both crime of armed criminal action and underlying felony, jury may convict of only one, and jury must be instructed that the two offenses are submitted in the alternative and jury may not convict defendant of more than one of them. State ex rel. Westfall v. Ruddy (Mo.), 621 S.W.2d 42.
(1983) Conviction and sentence for both armed criminal action and first degree robbery in a single trial is not violative of the double jeopardy clause of the Fifth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution where the Missouri General Assembly intended that the punishment be cumulative, regardless of whether the statutes proscribed the same conduct under the test in Blockburger v. United States, 284 U.S. 299, 52 S.Ct.  180, 76 L.Ed. 306 (1932). Missouri v. Hunter (U.S.), 103 S.Ct. 673.
(1991)  Where defendant was convicted of involuntary manslaughter and armed criminal action for causing the death of a person while driving in an intoxicated state, conviction was reversed because an armed criminal action requires a culpable mental state of acting purposely, knowingly or recklessly.  Criminal negligence will not support an armed criminal action charge.  State V. Hernandez, 815 S.W.2d 67 (Mo. App.).
(1993) In order for an automobile to become a dangerous instrument for purposes of this section, the operator or user of the automobile must possess an intent and motive for the automobile to be an instrument of harm.  Mere recklessness in the operation of an automobile does not give rise to armed criminal action.  State v. Pogue, 851 S.W.2d 702 (Mo. App. S.D.).
(1996)  Statute is written in prohibitive sense and not as a grant of a right.  McDermott v. Carnahan, 934 S.W.2d (Mo.banc).
(1998) Defendant may be convicted of armed criminal action and underlying crime without violating double jeopardy.  State v. Blackman, 968 S.W.2d 138 (Mo.banc), State v. Flenoy, 968 S.W.2d 141 (Mo.banc).

  9.  (1)  The sheriff shall keep a record of all applications for a concealed carry permit or a provisional permit and his or her action thereon.  Any record of an application that is incomplete or denied for any reason shall be kept for a period not to exceed one year.  Any record of an application that was approved shall be kept for a period of one year after the expiration and nonrenewal of the permit.
  (2)  The sheriff shall report the issuance of a concealed carry permit or provisional permit to the concealed carry permit system.  All information on any such permit that is protected information on any driver's or nondriver's license shall have the same personal protection for purposes of sections 571.101 to 571.121.  An applicant's status as a holder of a concealed carry permit, provisional permit, or a concealed carry endorsement issued prior to August 28, 2013, shall not be public information and shall be considered personal protected information.  Information retained in the concealed carry permit system under this subsection shall not be distributed to any federal, state, or private entities and shall only be made available for a single entry query of an individual in the event the individual is a subject of interest in an active criminal investigation or is arrested for a crime.  A sheriff may access the concealed carry permit system for administrative purposes to issue a permit, verify the accuracy of permit holder information, change the name or address of a permit holder, suspend or revoke a permit, cancel an expired permit, or cancel a permit upon receipt of a certified death certificate for the permit holder.  Any person who violates the provisions of this subdivision by disclosing protected information shall be guilty of a class A misdemeanor.

  12.  For processing a renewal for a concealed carry permit pursuant to sections 571.101 to 571.121, the sheriff in each county shall charge a nonrefundable fee not to exceed fifty dollars which shall be paid to the treasury of the county to the credit of the sheriff's revolving fund.

  (3)  Beginning August 28, 2020, an active military member may complete the renewal of his or her endorsement or permit under subdivision (2) of this subsection* by mail.  To renew an endorsement or permit by mail, an active military member shall mail to the sheriff who issued his or her permit a renewal application, a copy of his or her current concealed carry permit, a military identification acceptable for in-person renewal of permits, and the renewal fee.  The active military member may pick up the renewed permit in person or may request the permit be mailed to a provided address by certified mail.  The sheriff may require the active military member to pay the postage and insurance costs associated with mailing the permit, but the costs shall not exceed ten dollars.

  572.010.  Chapter definitions. — As used in this chapter the following terms mean:
  (1)  "Advance gambling activity", a person advances gambling activity if, acting other than as a player, he or she engages in conduct that materially aids any form of gambling activity.  Conduct of this nature includes but is not limited to conduct directed toward the creation or establishment of the particular game, lottery, contest, scheme, device or activity involved, toward the acquisition or maintenance of premises, paraphernalia, equipment or apparatus therefor, toward the solicitation or inducement of persons to participate therein, toward the actual conduct of the playing phases thereof, toward the arrangement or communication of any of its financial or recording phases, or toward any other phase of its operation.  A person advances gambling activity if, having substantial proprietary control or other authoritative control over premises being used with his or her knowledge for purposes of gambling activity, he or she permits that activity to occur or continue or makes no effort to prevent its occurrence or continuation.  The supplying, servicing and operation of a licensed excursion gambling boat under sections 313.800 to 313.840 does not constitute advancing gambling activity;

  (4)  "Gambling", a person engages in gambling when he or she stakes or risks something of value upon the outcome of a contest of chance or a future contingent event not under his or her control or influence, upon an agreement or understanding that he or she will receive something of value in the event of a certain outcome.  Gambling does not include bona fide business transactions valid under the law of contracts, including but not limited to contracts for the purchase or sale at a future date of securities or commodities, and agreements to compensate for loss caused by the happening of chance, including but not limited to contracts of indemnity or guaranty and life, health or accident insurance; nor does gambling include playing an amusement device that confers only an immediate right of replay not exchangeable for something of value.  Gambling does not include any licensed activity, or persons participating in such games which are covered by sections 313.800 to 313.840;
  (5)  "Gambling device", any device, machine, paraphernalia or equipment that is used or usable in the playing phases of any gambling activity, whether that activity consists of gambling between persons or gambling by a person with a machine.  However, lottery tickets, policy slips and other items used in the playing phases of lottery and policy schemes are not gambling devices within this definition;

  573.525.  Purpose — findings. — 1.  It is the purpose of sections 573.525 to 573.537 to regulate sexually oriented businesses in order to promote the health, safety, and general welfare of the citizens of this state, and to establish reasonable and uniform regulations to prevent the deleterious secondary effects of sexually oriented businesses within the state.  The provisions of sections 573.525 to 573.537 have neither the purpose nor effect of imposing a limitation or restriction on the content or reasonable access to any communicative materials, including sexually oriented materials.  Similarly, it is neither the intent nor effect of sections 573.525 to 573.537 to restrict or deny access by adults to sexually oriented materials protected by the first amendment, or to deny access by the distributors and exhibitors of sexually oriented entertainment to their intended market.  Neither is it the intent nor effect of sections 573.525 to 573.537 to condone or legitimize the distribution of obscene material.
  2.  The general assembly finds that:
  (1)  Sexually oriented businesses, as a category of commercial enterprises, are associated with a wide variety of adverse secondary effects, including but not limited to personal and property crimes, prostitution, potential spread of disease, lewdness, public indecency, obscenity, illicit drug use and drug trafficking, negative impacts on surrounding properties, urban blight, litter, and sexual assault and exploitation;
  (2)  Sexually oriented businesses should be separated from sensitive land uses to minimize the impact of their secondary effects upon such uses, and should be separated from other sexually oriented businesses, to minimize the secondary effects associated with such uses and to prevent an unnecessary concentration of sexually oriented businesses in one area;
  (3)  Each of the foregoing negative secondary effects constitutes a harm which the state has a substantial interest in preventing or abating, or both.  Such substantial government interest in preventing secondary effects, which is the state's rationale for sections 573.525 to 573.537, exists independent of any comparative analysis between sexually oriented and nonsexually oriented businesses.  Additionally, the state's interest in regulating sexually oriented businesses extends to preventing future secondary effects of current or future sexually oriented businesses that may locate in the state.

  589.503.  Purpose. — The compacting states to this Interstate Compact recognize that each state is responsible for the supervision of adult offenders in the community who are authorized pursuant to the Bylaws and Rules of this compact to travel across state lines both to and from each compacting state in such a manner as to track the location of offenders, transfer supervision authority in an orderly and efficient manner, and when necessary return offenders to the originating jurisdictions.  The compacting states also recognize that Congress, by enacting the Crime Control Act, 4 U.S.C. Section 112 (1965), has authorized and encouraged compacts for cooperative efforts and mutual assistance in the prevention of crime.  It is the purpose of this compact and the Interstate Commission created hereunder, through means of joint and cooperative action among the compacting states:  to provide the framework for the promotion of public safety and protect the rights of victims through the control and regulation of the interstate movement of offenders in the community to provide for the effective tracking, supervision, and rehabilitation of these offenders by the sending and receiving states; and to equitably distribute the costs, benefits and obligations of the compact among the compacting states.  In addition, this compact will:  create an Interstate Commission which will establish uniform procedures to manage the movement between states of adults placed under community supervision and released to the community under the jurisdiction of courts, paroling authorities, corrections or other criminal justice agencies which will promulgate rules to achieve the purpose of this compact; ensure an opportunity for input and timely notice to victims and to jurisdictions where defined offenders are authorized to travel or to relocate across state lines; establish a system of uniform data collection, access to information on active cases by authorized criminal justice officials, and regular reporting of Compact activities to heads of state councils, state executive, judicial, and legislative branches and criminal justice administrators; monitor compliance with rules governing interstate movement of offenders and initiate interventions to address and correct noncompliance; and coordinate training and education regarding regulations of interstate movement of offenders for officials involved in such activity.  The compacting states recognize that there is no "right" of any offender to live in another state and that duly accredited officers of a sending state may at all times enter a receiving state and there apprehend and retake any offender under supervision subject to the provisions of this compact and Bylaws and Rules promulgated hereunder.  It is the policy of the compacting states that the activities conducted by the Interstate Commission created herein are the formation of public policies and are therefore public business.

  2.  The crime victims' compensation fund is not a state health program and is not intended to be used as a primary payor to other health care assistance programs, but is a public, quasi-charitable fund whose fundamental purpose is to assist victims of violent crimes through a period of financial hardship, as a payor of last resort.  Accordingly, any compensation paid pursuant to sections 595.010 to 595.075 shall be reduced by the amount of any payments, benefits or awards received or to be received as a result of the injury or death:
  (1)  From or on behalf of the offender;
  (2)  Under private or public insurance programs, including Tricare, Medicare, Medicaid and other state or federal programs, but not including any life insurance proceeds; or
  (3)  From any other public or private funds, including an award payable pursuant to the workers' compensation laws of this state.
  3.  In determining the amount of compensation payable, the department of public safety shall determine whether, because of the victim's consent, provocation, incitement or negligence, the victim contributed to the infliction of the victim's injury or death, and shall reduce the amount of the compensation or deny the claim altogether, in accordance with such determination; provided, however, that the department of public safety may disregard the responsibility of the victim for his or her own injury where such responsibility was attributable to efforts by the victim to aid a victim, or to prevent a crime or an attempted crime from occurring in his or her presence, or to apprehend a person who had committed a crime in his or her presence or had in fact committed a felony.
  4.  In determining the amount of compensation payable pursuant to sections 595.010 to 595.075, monthly Social Security disability or retirement benefits received by the victim shall not be considered by the department as a factor for reduction of benefits.

  (1)  A claim in which the alleged assailant has not been brought to trial and disclosure of the information or a public hearing would adversely affect either the apprehension, or the trial, of the alleged assailant;

  4.  Whenever compensation is awarded to a claimant who is entitled to restitution from a criminal defendant, the department may initiate restitution hearings in such criminal proceedings or intervene in the same.  The department shall be entitled to receive restitution in such proceedings to the extent compensation was awarded; provided, however, the department shall be exempt from the payment of any fees or other charges for the recording of restitution orders in the offices of the judges of probate.  The claimant shall notify this department when restitution is ordered.  Failure to notify the department will result in possible forfeiture of any amount already received from the department.
  5.  Whenever the department shall deem it necessary to protect, maintain or enforce the department's right to subrogation or to exercise any of its powers or to carry out any of its duties or responsibilities, the attorney general may initiate legal proceedings or intervene in legal proceedings as the department's legal representative.
